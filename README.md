Boundaries / Scope (where the functions and responsibilities of the solution start and end / what it should do and what is left to other systems to do) <br/>
Success criteria (set of conditions to be satisfied at completion; must be measurable and verifiable, like a test)
Constraints (externally imposed limitations on system requirements, design, or implementation or on the process used to develop or modify a system) <br/>
Assumptions (things that are accepted as true or as certain to happen, without proof) <br/>
Stakeholders (individuals or organizations having a right, share, claim, or interest in a system or in its possession of characteristics that meet their needs and expectations) <br/>
Timelines (for software, a breakdown of high level goals like from the Product Backlog into time-bound smaller, more detailed tasks, like in Sprint Backlogs) <br/>

Professor - for grade

Parents - investing in my education and future success, want to make them proud

Perspective Employers - artifact will be added to my student portfolio which could help with getting a job

-Timeline
Week: 

Chapter One - Why we Program? (3 hours)
Overall, week 1 was just an overview of what the course will look like over the next couple weeks. We were introduced to some of the authors of the textbook which was really cool to see because we got some in site on why they made the course a certain way. I really liked Guido van Rossum who is the creator of Python. We learned why we program.

  Week 3 was also why we program. This really showed the importance of programming and the benefit it has on society for all people. Programming shows me how important of a skill this is and why programmers are so important to the marketplace.
  
Chapter Two: Variables and Expressions (3 hours)
I like variables and expressions. This section showed me which variables and expressions are appriate to use when programming. We learned that there are resereved words that can not be used for programming. Examples would be False,class,is and lambda. We learned that a variable is a named place in memory where a programmer can store data and later retrieve the data using the variable "name". Programmers get to choose which names are variables. Must start with a letter or underscore and must consist of letter, numbers, and underscores. Good: spam eggs Bad: 23spam #sign. 
Code is a really important aspect of coding. It shows us how to do different Numeric Expressions and symbol. +, means addition. -, means subtraction. *, means mulitiplication. /, means division. **, means power. % means remainder. These operation allow use to make things such as calculators making basic math simplier for the world. Because of the lack of mathical symbols on the keyboard we use different expressions for math signs as stated above.

Chapter Three: Conditional Code (3 hours)
In Chapter 3 we learned about conditional code. This important because it allows us to make conditins in our code using if and elif statements. We learned what can be used for this and what can not be used for conditional code. I think this important because it makes our project more dynamic allowing us to make it more interesting.
